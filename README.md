# Hard-To-Build-A-Die

This is a simple prototype at the moment of a game where you play as a cube who wants to be a die. You roll onto die faces to collect them and win the level when all six faces are attached. The rules are as follows:

1) A valid die has opposite faces sum to 7 (1 + 6, 2 + 5, 3 + 4) and you may not collect a face if it plus its opposite don't sum to 7.
2) If a face on the die would sum to 7 with a new face, it must be the opposite face.

So if you try to roll onto a face and these rules aren't satisfied, you're automatically rolled back.

This is just a prototype and it doesn't really feel like the game has much more potential than that, but maybe a more talented puzzle designer than myself could do something with this, or maybe it'll provide a nice momentary diversion for puzzle fans.
